### If you have any doubts about the questions below, please reach out to Zcash Foundation's Ecosystem Relations Manager, [decentralistdan](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/u/decentralistdan/summary), on the [Zcash forums](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/).

# Applicant background
Summarize you and/or your team’s background and experience. Demonstrate that you have the skills and expertise necessary for the project that you’re proposing. Institutional bona fides are not required, but we want to hear about your track record.

# Description of Problem or Opportunity  
In addition to describing the problem/opportunity, please give a sense of how serious or urgent of a need you believe this to be. What evidence do you have? What validation have you already done, or how do you think you could validate this?

# Proposed Solution
Describe the solution at a high level. How will this benefit the Zcash community? Please be specific about who the users and stakeholders are and how they would interact with your solution. E.g. retail ZEC holders, Zcash core devs, wallet devs, DeFi users, potential Zcash community participants.  

# Solution Format
What is the exact form of the deliverable you’re creating? E.g. code shipped within the zcashd and zebra code bases, a website, a feature within a wallet, a text/markdown file, user manuals, etc.

# Technical approach
Dive into the _how_ of your project. Describe your approaches, components, workflows, methodology, etc. Bullet points and diagrams are appreciated!

# How big of a problem would it be to not solve this problem?

# Execution risks
What obstacles do you expect? What is most likely to go wrong? Which unknown factors or dependencies could jeopardize success? Who would have to incorporate your work in order for it to be usable?

# Unintended Consequences
What are the negative ramifications if your project is successful? Consider usability, stability, privacy, integrity, availability, decentralization, interoperability, maintainability, technical debt, requisite education, etc.

# Evaluation plan
What metrics for success can you share with the community once you’re done? In addition to quantitative metrics, what qualitative metrics do you think you could report?

# Schedule and Milestones
What is your timeline for the project? Include concrete milestones and the major tasks required to complete each milestone. Please note that individual milestones with verifiable deliverables and a detailed budget are specified at the next step of the grant application process.

# Budget
How much funding do you need, and how will it be allocated (e.g., compensation for your effort, specific equipment, specific external services)? The budget should match the deliverables and completion dates to be provided in the next step. Convention has been for applicants to base their budget on hours of work and an hourly rate, but we are open to proposals based on the value of outcomes instead.
